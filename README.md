- Assess recall exposure by vehicle model
- Examine short-term correlation between recall activity and demand
- Determine whether operational risk is concentrated in primary revenue drivers

## 📊 Key Findings

### Seasonal Demand Pattern
- Strong profit growth observed in the first half of 2024.
- Systemic contraction occurred in August and December.
- Similar pattern observed across multiple years, indicating seasonality.

### Volume-Driven Profit Volatility
- Monthly profit closely mirrors quantity sold.
- Demand contraction — not margin compression — is the primary driver of volatility.
- Sales slowdown affected all major dealers and models.

### Recall Impact Assessment
- Recall spikes did not directly precede profit declines.
- Sales momentum continued despite recall events earlier in the year.
- No strong short-term recall-to-demand correlation observed.

### Revenue Risk Distribution
- Hudson is the top-selling model.
- Beaufort has the highest recall count.
- Recall exposure is not concentrated in the primary revenue-generating model.
- Champlain shows relatively high recall activity despite low sales volume.
