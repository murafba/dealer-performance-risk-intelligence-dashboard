# Dealer Performance & After-Sales Risk Intelligence Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

This Business Intelligence case study analyzes dealer performance, seasonal sales volatility, and recall exposure using IBM Cognos Analytics.

The objective is to evaluate revenue drivers, identify systemic demand patterns, and assess operational risk distribution across dealers and vehicle models.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Evaluate dealer-level profit contribution
- Identify seasonal volatility in sales performance
- Assess recall exposure by vehicle model
- Examine short-term correlation between recall activity and demand
- Determine whether operational risk is concentrated in primary revenue drivers

## 📊 Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Seasonal Demand Pattern
- Strong profit growth observed in the first half of 2024.
- Systemic contraction occurred in August and December.
- Similar pattern observed across multiple years, indicating seasonality.

### 2️⃣ Volume-Driven Profit Volatility
- Monthly profit closely mirrors quantity sold.
- Demand contraction — not margin compression — is the primary driver of volatility.
- Sales slowdown affected all major dealers and models.

### 3️⃣ Recall Activity Does Not Show Immediate Demand Impact
- Recall spikes did not directly precede profit declines.
- Sales momentum continued despite recall events earlier in the year.
- No strong short-term recall-to-demand correlation observed.

### 4️⃣ Revenue Driver Risk Assessment
- Hudson is the top-selling model.
- Beaufort has the highest recall count.
- Recall exposure is not concentrated in the primary revenue-generating model.

### 5️⃣ Model-Level Risk Distribution
- Champlain shows relatively high recall activity despite low sales volume.
- Indicates potential model-specific quality concerns rather than systemic revenue threat.
